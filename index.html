   <h1>New to gaming? Look no further</h1>
   <p>A small guide of reccomended games to try for new players</p>
   <h3>Intro</h3>
   <p> Many people are often shy to start gaming simply because they 
     don't know where to start. Here are my <strong>personal reccomendations</strong> 
     for games you could give a try to get a taste of what lies further. 
     There will be a decent variety of games (All of which I have played) 
     to pick from and test out! I hope this helps you out!</p>
   <h2>Minecraft</h2>

   <p class="summary"> Minecraft is a great game to start out with. 
     Available on almost all platforms, it's very easy to get started. 
     You can play <strong>Survival mode,</strong> which allows you to 
     gather resources and craft items in order to stay safe during your 
     adventure. There is also a <strong>Creative mode</strong> which
     allows you to build whatever you want with unlimited resources. 
     You can also play on <strong>Servers</strong> which allow you to 
     connect with people all over the world and play various minigames 
     and other fun activities!
   <h4>Personal Rating: 10/10</h4>
   <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>

   <p>If you love open world exploration and beautiful music, Genshin Impact 
     is your game. It is an action/adventure JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing game)which 
     features amazing exploration, fun characters and weapons, really cool combat, 
     and my personal favorite, THE MUSIC. After leveling up to a certain point, you 
     unlock a Co-op mode, granting you access to play with other players in order to 
     fight bosses and progress your characters. This game is a bit of a grinder so 
     if you're ok with taking your time, this is for you!
