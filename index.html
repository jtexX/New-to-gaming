   <h1>New to gaming? Look no further</h1>
   <p class="intro">A small guide of reccomended games to try for new players</p>
   <h3>Intro</h3>
   <p>Many people are often shy to start gaming simply because they 
     don't know where to start. Here are my <strong>personal reccomendations</strong> 
     for games you could give a try to get a taste of what lies further. 
     There will be a decent variety of games (All of which I have played) 
     to pick from and test out! I hope this helps you out!</p>
   
      <h2>Minecraft</h2>

    <p class="summary"> Minecraft is a great game to start out with. 
     Available on almost all platforms, it's very easy to get started. 
     You can play <strong>Survival mode,</strong> which allows you to 
     gather resources and craft items in order to stay safe during your 
     adventure. There is also a <strong>Creative mode</strong> which
     allows you to build whatever you want with unlimited resources. 
     You can also play on <strong>Servers</strong> which allow you to 
     connect with people all over the world and play various minigames 
     and other fun activities!</p>

   <h2>Genshin Impact</h2>

  <p class="summary">If you love open world exploration and beautiful music, Genshin Impact 
     is your game. It is an action/adventure JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing game)which 
     features amazing exploration, fun characters and weapons, really cool combat, 
     and my personal favorite, THE MUSIC. After leveling up to a certain point, you 
     unlock a Co-op mode, granting you access to play with other players in order to 
     fight bosses and progress your characters. This game is a bit of a grinder so 
    if you're ok with taking your time, this is for you!</p>

   <h2>Abzu</h2>

  <div class="caption">
   <p class="summary">A shorter and simpler game than the others, Abzu is all about ocean exploration... 
     and a little bit extra. With it's stunning imagery and mesmorizing music, it's an
     entire experience. Taking place underwater, you swim through different levels, 
     exploring and solving small puzzles to help you progress. I would <strong>HIGHLY 
     RECCOMEND</strong> taking a swing at this one.</p>

   <h2>God of War(PS4)</h2>

    <img src="images/kratos.jpg" alt="God of War Logo" width=400 decoding="async">
  </summary>
  <div class="caption">
   <p class="summary">Hands down one of the best singleplayer experiences you can get, unfortunately 
     it is only available on PS4. This game is absolutely gorgeous, the story telling,
     the music, and the locations. Also has some of the best combat I've ever seen. 
     If you don't mind voilence, this game is really fun, but if you are more sensitive 
     then you might want to look for another title, some of these take downs are just brutal.</p>
